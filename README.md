# RISC-V RV32I Simulator

This is a simulator for the RISC-V RV32I instruction set architecture. It is implemented in C++ and uses the Qt framework for user interface.

## Features

* Supports all RV32I instructions
* Configurable memory size
* Breakpoints and single-stepping
* Visualization of the instruction execution pipeline

## Getting Started

To build the simulator, you will need the following:

* A C++ compiler

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can build the simulator and run it using your compiler of choice.

The simulator will query for information about the assembly instructions with a simple user interface. 

The simulator also provides a visualization of the instruction execution pipeline. This can be helpful for understanding how the instructions are executed and how the pipeline works. To view the pipeline, click on the "Pipeline" button.
